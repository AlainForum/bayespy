# BayesPy

BayesPy provides tools for Bayesian inference with Python.

The user may construct a model as a Bayesian network, observe data and
run posterior inference.  Currently, only variational Bayesian
inference for conjugate-exponential family (variational message
passing) has been implemented.  Future work includes other types of
distributions and possibly other approximate inference methods such as
expectation propagation, Laplace approximations, Markov chain Monte
Carlo and other methods.
