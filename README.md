# BayesPy

BayesPy provides tools for Bayesian inference with Python.

The user may construct a model as a Bayesian network, observe data and
run posterior inference.  Currently, only variational Bayesian
inference has been implemented but future work might include
expectation propagation, laplace approximations, Markov chain Monte
Carlo and other methods.
